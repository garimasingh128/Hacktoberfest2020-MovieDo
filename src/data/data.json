    "name": "Creed-II",
    "desc": "“Creed II” falls victim to the sins of sequelitis—it’s bigger, louder and more grandiose than its predecessor—yet manages to right itself by not losing focus on the humanity of its central characters. The lives of Adonis “Donnie” Creed (Michael B. Jordan), his girlfriend Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and his mentor Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) are as lovingly dwelled upon as they were in Ryan Coogler’s original. There is more suspense in whether Rocky will reunite with his son, and in the struggles of the newly married Creed couple, than in any punch thrown in the boxing ring. It’s commendable that the film is committed to the character-based world building evident in the first “Creed.” With this sequel, however, the Creed franchise seems destined to travel the same road the Rocky franchise did; the intensely personal and original vision of its creator is slowly being corrupted by the seductive demons of fan service.",
