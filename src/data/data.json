Thappad is one of those movies which apart from keeping you entertained provokes to think about the sex differences prevailing in society. The actor in this movie have done great justice to their characters. The character of women in movie from different walk of life revolves around the main character Amrita and how one brave decision of Amrita encourage them all to take stand for themselves. The movie doesn't have so much flavour in it but it keeps you glued to your sofas till the end. The plot and the story line, even the dialogues of the movie are very inspiring. It also teaches us that sometimes empathy is all that we need towards each other to avoid big chaos in lives. A must watch movie Thappad....",
